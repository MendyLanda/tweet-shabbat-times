# ZmanimAPI

Welcome to the ZmanimAPI repository!

This project is a library for calculating various Jewish calendar times (zmanim). The API was reverse engineered and wrapped around the Chabad.org API.

## Changes Coming Soon

Please note that this project was spawned up quickly (two days) and is subject to major refactoring. In the near future, the ZmanimAPI will be split off into its own repository, while the Twitter functionality will be moved to a separate repository.

## Purpose

The original purpose of this project was to post Shabbat times on Twitter. However, as the project has grown, it has become a more general-purpose library for calculating zmanim.

## Usage

I will write something soon. Maybe throw ChatGPT at it.
